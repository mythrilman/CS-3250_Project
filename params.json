{"name":"Upvoats by the Numbers","tagline":"How the Front Page of Reddit Affects Small Subreddits","body":"### Github Repository: https://github.com/mythrilman/CS-3250_Project \r\n\r\nThis project will examine the effects of “15 minutes of fame” by attempting to survey the impact of crowds and popularity on smaller communities. Reddit will be used as a source of date. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) calls Reddit “an online bulletin board system”. According to [Mashable](http://mashable.com/category/reddit/), Reddit is an online message board where users post information and submit links. These posts are then up voted if they are liked or down voted if they are disliked. The intention being popular posts rise to the more visible top, while unpopular posts sink to the less noticed bottom. A post’s “points”, or popularity value, is also weighted by time. The resulting effect being that the longer a post exists the more difficulty it will have in remaining high in the popularity rankings.  \r\n\r\n### Who Uses Reddit?\r\n\r\nReddit has a diverse following. According to Reddit’s own statistics over two hundred million people visit the sight monthly from over 217 countries. An interesting fact considering that there are only 196 countries according to [WorldAtlas.com](http://www.worldatlas.com/nations.htm). However, Google found the average user to be a United States male ranging in age from 18 to 29. The users of Reddit have intentions that are just as diverse minded as its followers, with uses ranging from entertainment, access to news, and of course the collection or proliferation of adult content. \r\n\r\n### Data Collection\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, there are three measures of popularity on Reddit. The first is the number of subscribers to a themed message board, or “subreddit” as they are called. This number provides an idea of how many users follow this subreddit on a regular basis. The larger the number of followers the more popular a subreddit is. Next, the number of current viewers tells how many users are presently viewing a subreddit. Current viewers can be subscribers or not. The number of present viewers tells the popularity of the subreddit at that very moment. Finally, the number of points a post has is an indication of its current popularity. Since a posts point score is tied to it’s up and down votes it is not merely a count of how many people have viewed it but of how well it is liked, or disliked\r\nThese measures of popularity will be harvested from Reddit in the form of strings of text and numbers. Python scripts will be a likely source for collecting, formatting and managing the data. R will be used to analyze the resulting collections. Data collection will be done periodically from a selection of subreddits, some popular some not. Data collection will also follow trending subreddits. \r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\nThe collected data will reveal movements of users from the main page and their effect on the popularity of the subreddits they move through. Questions such as: How do crowds affect the popularity of subreddits? Is the influx of views long lasting or short lived? How does fleeting popularity, a sudden increase of present viewers, relate to subscribers and the average number of comments per post on a subreddit that gets new prominence on the front page.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n[Jonathan Rosen](https://github.com/mythrilman)\r\n\r\n[Alex Woodie](https://github.com/AlexanderWoodie)\r\n\r\n[Jason Phares](https://github.com/SasquatchMighty)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
